> Repository for the masters course in Special Topics in Optimization: Intelligent Techniques

## Content
The repository contains presentations and code tasks. Each one is separated in sub-directories, containing python modules and a Jupyter Notebook, which serves as documentation and can be executed to demonstrate how the algorithms work.

## Installation
> This project runs on Python 3.8 and conda, make sure you have them installed

The Makefile can be used to create a conda environment:

`make conda-create`

This command will create a conda environemnt titled: `msc-210115`. You can check which packages it installs by looking at the environment.yml file.

After creating the environment activate it:

`conda activate msc-210115`

This enviroment works for all the notebooks and executions in this project.
